Q: Why are these images in this directory and not in the Unity project?

A: A lot of these are not going to be usable in Unity/any normal game engine. At least one of these spritesheets (the Brinstar map) needs to be remade so that each frame is spaced uniformly so that Unity can slice it smoothly.

The only images that should be in the Unity project directory are ones being directly used in the game.
