# WANIC-Teacher-Metroid
Metroid clone in Unity.

## Unity Version
The currently uploaded project is using an old version of Unity, so DO NOT download the project at this time. We will upload a version using a newer build as soon as we can and will remove this disclaimer once that is done. In the meantime, if you do any work, please make sure you are using Unity version 2018.3.0f2 (the same version that is installed on the WANIC student computers). This is the version we will be using for this project.

## Version Control Guidelines
* Use [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), or the git CLI to clone/push/pull from this repository. Do *not* use an SVN client!

* When committing, provide a helpful message in the imperative form (i.e., when this commit is applied, X will happen), such as "Add script for enemy movemement" or "Update texture for Samus run animation" or "Fix animation controller glitch when jumping". Avoid commiting several unrelated things in a single commit.

* When committing assets within the Unity project directory, make sure you commit the **.meta** files as well, as they contain information necessary for the project to work correctly.
